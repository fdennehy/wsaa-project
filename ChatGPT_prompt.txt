ChatGPT was responsioble for the majority of the dashboard.html file.
Prompt provided to ChatGPT after the DAO and Server files were created:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a backend developer and have created a mySQL database with two tables containing account and contact information, joined on account id. 
I have created x2 DAO files to perform operations on the database. I have also created a flask server file with routes. 
Lastly, I have a template html file which contains a combination of html, javascript and ajax. I will share these files with you one at a time.

You are a front end developer. Your assignment is to carefully review the files shared, and then provide a dashboards.html file. Your first iteration should:
- contain no more than 150 lines of code
- use the template html file as a guide
- contain account buttons to:
1) View all Account data
2) Add an Account by ID
3) Update Account by ID
4) Delete Account by ID
5) View all Contacts data
6) Create a (dummy) contact

Are you ready to be sent the different files?
